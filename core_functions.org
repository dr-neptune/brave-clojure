* Core Functions in Depth

In this chapter we learn about Clojure's underlying concept of programming to abstractions and about the sequence and collection abstractions. We will also learn about lazy sequences. 

We will also work with the functions:

- map
- reduce
- into
- conj
- concat
- some
- filter
- take
- drop
- sort
- sort-by
- identity
- apply
- partial
- complement

** Treating Lists, Vectors, Sets, and Maps as Sequences

map works on generics that are iterable.
